# Task Manager with Express Middleware
This project deepened my understanding of Express middlewares. It's a task management application that allows user creation and full CRUD operations on todos. Features include:

- Create, list, edit, mark as done, and delete todos.
- Free plan: up to 10 todos.
- Pro plan: unlimited todos.
Middleware was used for necessary validations.
